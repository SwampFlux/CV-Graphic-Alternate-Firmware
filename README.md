# CV Graphic Alternate Firmware

This is a placeholder created Feb 15 2018.

I just got my hands on a Minigorille CV Graphic and the software on it frustrates me. I want to see if I can rewrite the software to be just generally better, cooler, more intuitive, blah blah blah. Oh yeah, and open source.
